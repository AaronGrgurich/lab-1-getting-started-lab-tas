#Component One

Component One is the easiest Lab you will be doing, but also one of the most critical.  In this lab, you will be uploading a simple sketch onto your arduino, and running it.  

###Step One

The first thing to do is create the circuit.  Below is the circuit schematic.

###Step Two

Now that we are ready to program the arduino, the second step is to write the code. 

In the `setup()` method, initialize your pin from step one as an output. To do this, use the *pinmode* method: `pinMode(13, OUTPUT);`.  This sets pin `13` to be an `output`.
