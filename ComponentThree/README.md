# Component Three

In Component Three we will be expanding our program to include analog inputs, using the `analogRead(PIN)` method.  This method returns an `int` value. 

We will also be using the Serial Monitor built into arduino to transmit the analog value to our computer.  

Please see the given example until I finish documentation
